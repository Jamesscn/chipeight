**What makes this interpreter different from the rest?**

From what I have seen, most CHIP-8 interpreters run the instructions too fast to be played and require you to install a client. With the help of Javascript the run time should practically be the same on all machines and platforms.

Another thing to note is that the website doesn't rely on any frameworks or external scripts apart from the colour picker used to set the interpreters colours, so the page shouldn't take long to load.

I tried to comment the code as best I could, so I hope that if you decide to take a look at it you can understand it clearly.
